<h1>The Best Movies According to Tatyana</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>
    La La Land is a lovely, pleasing, and showstopping movie that should be watched on the biggest screen, 
    loudest sound, and brightest colors as possible. A celebration of music and magic, 
    where swelling emotions are captured by somber yet jazzy leitmotifs.
</p>
<h3>Jojo Rabbit</h3> 
<p>
    This is an inventive film. It is feel-good and heart-breaking. It has comedy and tragedy. It is an outside-the-box,
     brilliant film from the unusual Taika Waititi. The kid is brilliant. The best friend is funny. ScarJo is terrific. 
    There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best.

<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
<p>
    Luc Besson's The Fifth Element is a dazzling, funny, and exciting sci-fi actioner that features unforgettable characters and a thrilling story, 
    making this one of the most underrated science-fiction classics around.
